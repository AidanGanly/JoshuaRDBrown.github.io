<h1><u> Normalisation </u></h1>
<div>
<h2><u>What is Database normalisation?</u></h2>
<p> Database normalisation is the process of organizing attributes and tables of a relational database to reduce the risk of data redundancy and to improve data integrity, created by Edgar Codd to improve upon the already existing relational model (Shown below)</p>
<img src = "https://www.tutorialspoint.com/dbms/images/mapping_relationship.png">
<p> The first version of normal form (1NF) released in 1970, was to allow data to be queried in first-order logic using the universal data sub-language. SQL is an example of this.
The main focus was to reduce the dependancy on restructering relations, decrease types of anomolies (see box to the right) and to make it more user friendly.</p>
<h3><u> Forms of Normalisation </u></h3>
<p><b><u>1NF -</b></u> In the First Normal Form, rows cannot repeat groups of data, meaning each column must have a unique value, this is to prevent multiple columns trying to access the same row at the same time.</p>
<p><b><u>2NF -</b></u> In Second Normal Form, there shouldn't be dependency on any column with a primary key. Therefore for a table that has a linked primary key, columns not aflicted with the intial primary key must depend on a completely different key.</p>
<p><b><u>3NF -</b></u> In Third Normal Form, non-prime attributes of tables must be dependant on a given primary key so the problem of non-prime attributes determining themselves does not occur.</p>

<h2><u>Data anomolies</u></h2>
<p><b><u>Update Anomaly -</b></u> An Update Anomaly occurs when one or more instances of duplicated data is updated or changed, but some are still not.</p>
<p><b><u>Insertion Anomaly -</b></u> An Insertion Anomaly occurs when attributes cannot be added into a database without the presence of another attribute, this is the opposite of a deletion anomaly, where data is over stored.</p>
<p><b><u>Deletion Anomaly -</b></u> A Delete Anomaly occurs when attributes are lost or undefined because of the deletion of other attributes so the database is confused on where to link and store data to.</p>

<h3><u> Conditions of Normalisation </u></h3>
<p> For a database to be considered 'Normalised' it must meet certain criteria:</p>

<p> 1) All items in a column must have the same type.</p>
<p> 2) The number of columns must be the same for all rows in a table.</p>
<p> 3) It must be possible to uniquely identify each row.</p>
<p> 4) There is no implied row order requried.</p>
