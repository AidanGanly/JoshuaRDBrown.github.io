	<h2><u>What is a DBMS?</u></h2>
	<p>DBMS; which stands for DataBase Management System is a type of system software dedicated to creating and managing databases. This is an easy way to keep on top of data
	in a database. The main focus of a DMBS is to maintain a database which is easily accessable and which has a consistant organisation of data. It is also accountable for the
	security of a database, the integrity of the data and carrying out administrative prosedures.</p>

	<p class = "caption1"><b> API diagram of how a DBMS aranges data into a database.</b></p>
	<p>A DBMS offers physical and logical data independence for a database. </p>
	<h2><u>Alternatives to DBMS:</u></h2>
	<p><b>There are many alternatives to the standard DMBS that you should be aware of:</b></p>
	<h3><u>In-memory database</u></h3>
	<img class ="d" src = "https://raima.com/wp-content/uploads/TFS_processes.png"> 
	<p>Firstly there is <b>in-memory</b> databases. This database processes data using the system memory for faster results and lowered latency. It provides the option to optimize data management compared to normal disk-based data storing.</p>
	<h3><u>NoSQL</u></h3>
	<img class ="d2" src = "https://www.techopedia.com/images/uploads/fd41d681beb64bbba944151a54501308.jpg?width=280&mode=crop">
	<p> Another alternative is <b>NoSQL</b> databases. This is a specific system that does not follow the traditional database model, it has increased scalability and performance and is more capable for handling real time logical operations, such as those used for online banking transations for example.</p>
	<h3><u>Columnar databases</u></h3>
	<img class = "d2" src = "https://www.stitchdata.com/images/illustrations/guide-icon-columnar-8-0bbe588c.svg">
	<p>This database is a variation of a DMBS, however data is stored in columns instead of rows. The main purpose of this database is to increase read / write time from a hard disk to quickly return quries.</p>

<h2><u> Advantages of DBMS: </u></h2>
<h3> There are many advantages of using a DBMS, some include:</h3>
<ol>
<li>DBMS gives users and programmers access to use the same data while mantaining data integrity. This means data is better protected and organised instead of just iterations of the same data stored in new files.</li>
  <hr>
  <li>The DBMS provides a central hub for all data stored so that can be accessed by multiple users at once.</li>
  <hr>
  <li>DMBS also ensures data abstraction and independence inside of any given database. It also gives maximum security of all data stored and is less likely for a company to have to deal with a data breach.</li>
  <hr>
  <li>DMBS is also used for administrative purposes, all activity that goes on in the database is logged and saved to the admins computer (File deleted, file created) and by which user. </li>
  <hr>
  <li>DBMS can also recover very well from crashes and errors making recovery hassle free and reliablity high.</li>  
</ol>
<hr>

<h2><u> Disadvantages of DBMS: </u></h2>
<ol>
<li> DMBS supports multiple functionality to give the user the best experience, the back end software has become complex. Only experienced users will get the most out of using one.</li>
<hr>
<li>Because of the point above, it uses large amount of memory. It also needs large memory and a high performance CPU that supports multicore processing to run </li>
<hr>
<li>As said in the advantges, DMBS uses a centralized system, this means all the users from all over the world access this database. Furthermore, any failures of the DBMS will impact all the users.</li>
<hr>
<li>DBMS is generalized software, it is written work on the entire systems rather than a specific one. This means some of the application will run slower than programmed.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3><u>Types of DBMS</u></h3>
<img class = "d3" src = "examples.png">
<h3><u>SQLite</u></h3>
<p> Firstly we have SQLite, which is a serverless database which uses the a C programming library. It embedds SQL into a console in the application so quries can be run and tables can be created directly. It is one of the most popular for it's easy to use interface and its link to many programming languages.</p>
<h3><u>Microsoft access</u></h3>
<p> Next there is Microsoft access, this is more for beginner programmers or small business' without any technical experiences. It has a export and import feature so data can be sent or taken from other Microsoft office applications. It's also easier than a client-side server and you can directly publish your database to the web.</p>
<h3><u>Oracle</u></h3>
<p> Oracle is a cloud based database server, this means migration from system to system is easy. This makes data more secure and less vunerable to being deleted or stolen. It also works well with Linux and windows platforms. It is also extremely hardware flexible, variations in database hardware still allow all features of Oracle to be used.</p>
